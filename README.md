# Lesson Plan

## Pre-reqs

1. Git installed

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone your fork to your local machine
1. Add the upstream repository as a remote
1. Fetch all remotes and examine the history
1. Create a feature branch

    * This should have a very terse and non-descriptive name

1. Push the branch to origin and set it as the tracking branch
1. Add a file with a few lines of content and commit it to the branch

    * This commit message should be very cursory and short. Intended only for your own consumption at this point. We'll discuss better messages later.

1. Examine the current state of history
1. Briefly discuss how your prompt function's information can help you maintain context.
1. Add more content and generate at least two more work in progress commits
1. Push your commits to the remote tracking branch on origin
1. Examine the current state of history
1. Open a pull-request against upstream
1. Comment on classmates PR's and incorporate changes
1. The project maintainer wants a better branch name and commit message

    1. Branch from the current branch with a better name
    1. Squash the current commit history down to a single commit with a better message
    1. Next time you should probably do this from the start
